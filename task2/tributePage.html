        <div class="content" style="float: left;">
            Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman was an Indian physicist known for his work in the field of light
            scattering. Using a spectrograph that he developed, he and his student K. S. Krishnan discovered that when
            light traverses a transparent material, the deflected light changes its wavelength and frequency. This
            phenomenon, a hitherto unknown type of scattering of light, which they called "modified scattering" was
            subsequently termed the Raman effect or Raman scattering. Raman received the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics for
            the discovery and was the first Asian to receive a Nobel Prize in any branch of science.
            <br> <br> In 1917, he was appointed the first Palit Professor of Physics by Ashutosh Mukherjee at the
            Rajabazar Science College under the University of Calcutta. On his first trip to Europe, seeing the
            Mediterranean Sea motivated him to identify the prevailing explanation for the blue colour of the sea at the
            time, namely the reflected Rayleigh-scattered light from the sky, as being incorrect. He founded the Indian
            Journal of Physics in 1926.

                        <h1>Early Life & Education</h1>
                        <p>
                            C. V. Raman was born in Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu to Tamil Brahmin parents, Chandrasekhara
                            Ramanathan Iyer and Parvathi Ammal.He was the second of eight siblings.His father was a
                            teacher at a local high school, and earned a modest income. In 1892, his family moved to
                            Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh.
                            Raman was educated at the St Aloysius' Anglo-Indian High School, Visakhapatnam.He passed
                            matriculation at age 11 and the First Examination in Arts examination with a scholarship at
                            age 13, securing first position in both under the Andhra Pradesh school board examination.
                            In 1902, Raman joined Presidency College in Madras where his father had been transferred to
                            teach mathematics and physics. In 1904, he obtained a B.A. degree from the University of
                            Madras, where he stood first and won the gold medals in physics and English.At age 18, while
                            still a graduate student, he published his first scientific paper on "Unsymmetrical
                            diffraction bands due to a rectangular aperture" in the British journal Philosophical
                            Magazine in 1906.He earned an M.A. degree from the same university with highest distinction
                            in 1907.His second paper published in the same journal that year was on surface tension of
                            liquids.

                            Raman followed suit and qualified for the Indian Finance Service achieving first position in
                            the entrance examination in February 1907.He was posted in Calcutta as Assistant Accountant
                            General in June 1907.It was there that he became highly impressed with the Indian
                            Association for the Cultivation of Science, the first research institute founded in India in
                            1876.He immediately befriended Asutosh Dey, who would eventually become his lifelong
                            collaborator, Amrita Lal Sircar and Ashutosh Mukherjee, executive member of the institute
                            and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta. With their support, he obtained
                            permission to conduct research at IACS in his own time even "at very unusual hours," as
                            Raman later reminisced.Up to that time the institute had not yet recruited regular
                            researchers,or produced any research paper.Raman's article "Newton's rings in polarised
                            light" published in Nature in 1907 became the first from the institute.The work inspired
                            IACS to publish a journal, Bulletin of Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, in
                            1909 in which Raman was the major contributor

                        <p>
                            Raman married Lokasundari Ammal on 6 May 1907.It was a self-arranged
                            marriage and his wife was 13 years old. His wife later jokingly recounted that their
                            marriage was not so much about her musical prowess (she was playing veena when they first
                            met) as "the extra allowance which the Finance Department gave to its married officers."
                            The extra allowance refers to an additional INR 150 for married officers at the time.
                            Soon after they moved to Calcutta in 1907, the couple were accused of converting to
                            Christianity. It was because they frequently visited St. John's Church, Kolkata as
                            Lokasundari was fascinated with the church music and Raman with the acoustics.

                            They had two sons, Chandrasekhar Raman and Venkatraman Radhakrishnan, a radio astronomer.
                            Raman was the paternal uncle of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, recipient of the 1983 Nobel
                            Prize in Physics.

                            Throughout his life, Raman developed an extensive personal collection of stones, minerals,
                            and materials with interesting light-scattering properties, which he obtained from his world
                            travels and as gifts.He often carried a small, handheld spectroscope to study
                            specimens.These, along with his spectrograph, are on display at IISc.

                        <h3 class="sc">Musical sound</h3>
                        One of Raman's interests was on the scientific basis of musical sounds. He was inspired by
                        Hermann von Helmholtz's The Sensations of Tone, the book he came across when he joined IACS.He
                        published his findings prolifically between 1916 and 1921. He worked out the theory of
                        transverse vibration of bowed string instruments based on superposition of velocities.
                        <h3 class="sc">Blue colour of sea</h3>
                        Raman, in his broadening venture on optics, started to investigate scattering of light starting
                        in 1919. His first phenomenal discovery of the physics of light was the blue colour of seawater.
                        During a voyage home from England on board the S.S. Narkunda in September 1921, he contemplated
                        the blue colour of the Mediterranean Sea. Using simple optical equipment, a pocket-sized
                        spectroscope and a Nicol prism in hand, he studied the seawater.
                        <h3 class="sc">Raman effect</h3>
                        Raman's second important discovery on the scattering of light was a new type of radiation, an
                        eponymous phenomenon called the Raman effect.After discovering the nature of light scattering
                        that caused blue colour of water, he focused on the principle behind the phenomenon. His
                        experiments in 1923 showed the possibility of other light rays formed in addition to incident
                        ray when sunlight was filtered through a violet glass in certain liquids and solids. Ramanathan
                        believed that this was a case of a "trace of fluorescence".

                        At the end of October 1970, Raman had a cardiac arrest and collapsed in his laboratory. He was
                        moved to the hospital where doctors diagnosed his condition and declared that he would not
                        survive another four hours.He however survived a few days and requested to stay in the
                        gardens of his institute surrounded by his followers.

                        Two days before Raman died, he told one of his former students, "Do not allow the journals of
                        the Academy to die, for they are the sensitive indicators of the quality of science being done
                        in the country and whether science is taking root in it or not." That evening, Raman met
                        with the Board of Management of his institute in his bedroom and discussed with them the fate of
                        the institute's management.He also willed his wife to perform a simple cremation without
                        any rituals upon his death. He died from natural causes early the next morning on 21 November
                        1970 at the age of 82.
